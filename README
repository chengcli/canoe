found error with vapor pressure functions:

when vapor pressure are too low (~1e-10 Pa) at low temperatuers, the saturationadjustment fails and eventually crashes

when vapor pressures are too high (1e5 Pa) eg. for CO2, the saturation adjustment fails immediately (all nan)

exo can use cores 24/96/384/1536
also permit 216/600/864/1176/ if specify NBLOCKS in the .cmake file
