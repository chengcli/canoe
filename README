found error with vapor pressure functions:

when vapor pressure are too low (~1e-10 Pa) at low temperatuers, the saturationadjustment fails and eventually crashes

when vapor pressures are too high (1e5 Pa) eg. for CO2, the saturation adjustment fails immediately (all nan)

exo can use cores 24/96/384/1536: 6*4^n
also permit 216/600/864/1176/1536/1944/2400... (24*n^2) if specify NBLOCKS in the .cmake file
That is, if meshblock is x, the mesh should be x*4*n, and x*6*n, for example, if x is 10, mesh could be 40/60, or 240/360 etc.
meshblock = 5 is not very efficient, maybe meshblock is 8 or higher


gammal in svp is  delta[n] = (cp_ratio_mass[n] - cp_ratio_mass[i]) * mu_ratio[i] / (1. - 1. / gammad);

cp_ratio_mass is rcp
mu_ratio is eps
