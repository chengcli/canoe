 * and set epsilon inside the fcmp() function.
 *
 * Description:
 *   It is generally not wise to compare two floating-point values for
 *   exact equality, for example using the C == operator.  The function
 *   fcmp() implements Knuth's suggestions for safer floating-point
 *   comparison operators, from:
 *   Knuth, D. E. (1998). The Art of Computer Programming.
 *   Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms. 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley.
 *   Section 4.2.2, p. 233. ISBN 0-201-89684-2.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   x1, x2: numbers to be compared
 *
 * This routine may be used for both single and double precision.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   -1 if x1 < x2
 *    0 if x1 == x2
 *    1 if x1 > x2

   * Get exponent(max(fabs(x1),fabs(x2))) and store it in exponent.
   *
   * If neither x1 nor x2 is 0,
   * this is equivalent to max(exponent(x1),exponent(x2)).
   *
   * If either x1 or x2 is 0, its exponent returned by frexp would be 0,
   * which is much larger than the exponents of numbers close to 0 in
   * magnitude. But the exponent of 0 should be less than any number
   * whose magnitude is greater than 0.
   *
   * So we only want to set exponent to 0 if both x1 and x2 are 0.
   * Hence, the following works for all x1 and x2.
