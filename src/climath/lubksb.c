/*! Solves the set of n linear equations A X = B. Here
 * a[0..n-1][0..n-1] is input, not as the matrix A but rather as its LU
 decomposition, determined by the routine ludcmp.
 * indx[0..n-1] is input as the permutation vector returned by ludcmp.
 * b[0..n-1] is input as the right-hand side vector B, and returns with the
 solution vector X.
 * a, n, and indx are not modified by this routine and can be left in place for
 * successive calls with different right-hand sides b.
 * This routine takes into account the possibility that b will begin with many
 zero elements,
 * so it is efficient for use in matrix inversion.
